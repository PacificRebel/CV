## HELI SIVUNEN

I'm a newly qualified full stack developer and really good at making TV news. I love working in teams of every size! 

I've graduated from the Makers bootcamp in London. Team and pair programming are my thing, and I love tinkering  
with the visuals of a page.  

I'm a tree-hugging vegan, and member of ITN's Sustainability Forum, where we work to reduce carbon footprint.
