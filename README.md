## Full Stack / Front End Developer with TV news background ðŸŽ¬

I'm a graduate of the Makers bootcamp in London and work for Channel 4 News. I'm particularly excited about front end work,  
especially building beautiful, user-friendly apps and immersive scrollytelling pages. I love it when something small I built  
elicits reactions of wonder from those I demo it to!

I want to put my programming skills to use for the benefit of our planet, and see endless possibilities for this. I'm a  
tree-hugging vegan, and member of my company's Sustainability Forum, where we work to reduce carbon footprint.

I also want to demystify programming for those who aren't normally drawn into it as a career, especially girls. Inclusive  
design fascinates me and I want to become good at it!
