## HELI SIVUNEN

I'm a developer and multi-skilled TV journalist at Channel 4 News, highly experienced at producing 
national and international news for programmes, rolling news and digital output. Whether in coding 
or TV production, I love working in small and large groups of talented professionals, and I'm proud 
to foster a great atmosphere and relationships within my teams. 

I am a graduate of Makers, a 12-week, selective developer bootcamp in London. I’m currently working on 
a couple of React projects and taking a top-up React course at Makers to improve my front-end skills. 
I’ve done most of my learning in Ruby/Rails and have also written projects in JavaScript and Swift. 
I’m also learning to make beautiful scrollytelling web pages. I really enjoy pair programming and 
teamwork, and have completed several group projects with Agile practices and a rigorous workflow.

Whilst working in my current job, I was selected to train Avid video editing to more than a hundred 
ITN staff. During Avid's 'train the trainer' course, I became interested in developing the software, 
as well as being an end user. I'm now hoping to use my TV production experience to help companies 
excite their audiences and business clients with elegant but highly practical software.

I care deeply about the environment. I have experience in corporate carbon footprint reduction as I'm a 
member of ITN's Sustainability Forum, which works to improve the company’s environmental credentials.

## Experience

**Channel 4 News, ITN** (2000-present)

the world for CNN's output. We experimented with new tech including TOKO, which allowed CNN to go live to

my grandfather was fighting in the Finnish Continuation War during WWII.
