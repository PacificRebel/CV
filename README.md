## Full Stack / Front End Developer with TV news background ðŸŽ¬

I'm a full stack developer, a recent graduate of the Makers bootcamp in London and work for Channel 4 News.  
I'm particularly excited about front end work, especially building beautiful, user-friendly apps and immersive scrollytelling pages.  
I love it when something small I've built elicits reactions of wonder from those I demo it to! For example, I've recently built and deployed  
websites with birthday greetings for friends and family instead of cards - a joy to receive, and great for the environment too.  

I want to put my programming skills to use for the benefit of our planet, and see endless possibilities for this.  
I'm a tree-hugging vegan, and member of my company's Sustainability Forum, where we work to reduce carbon footprint.  

I also want to demystify programming for those who aren't normally drawn into it as a career, especially girls.  
I got into programming myself thanks to a RailsGirls workshop, and have been programming with my daughter on Sphero Edu and Scratch.  
Inclusive design fascinates me and I want to become good at it - I knew the issues but Chimmy Kalu's talk at this year's  
Women Driven Development conference was an eye-opener for me.
