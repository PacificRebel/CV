## HELI SIVUNEN

I'm a developer and multi-skilled journalist at Channel 4 News, highly experienced at producing  
visually engaging TV News. Whether in coding or TV production, I love working in small and large  
groups of talented professionals, and I'm proud to foster a great atmosphere within my team.  

I am a graduate of Makers, a 12-week, selective developer bootcamp in London. I’m currently working on  
a couple of React projects and taking a top-up React course at Makers to improve my front-end skills.  
I’ve done most of my learning in Ruby/Rails and have written projects in JavaScript and Swift.  
I’m also learning to make beautiful scrollytelling web pages with HTML and CSS. I really enjoy pair  
programming and teamwork, and have completed several group projects with Agile practices and a  
rigorous workflow.

Whilst working in my current job, I was selected to train Avid video editing to more than a hundred  
ITN staff. During Avid's 'train the trainer' course, I became interested in developing the software,  
not just being an end user. I'm now hoping to use my TV production experience to help companies  
excite their audiences and business clients with elegant but highly practical software.  

I care deeply about the environment. I have experience in corporate carbon footprint reduction as I'm  
a member of ITN's Sustainability Forum, which works to improve the company’s environmental credentials.

Because of my TV production and video editing background, I have an eye for what works visually on  
a page.
I'm experienced at visual storytelling, and have been teaching myself 'scrollytelling' with beautiful  
web pages.  
I'm full stack, but most interested in front-end developing and love working with video and images.

#### TV journalism / communication

- I'm an excellent communicator, and, being a journalist, can condense complex information and present  
  it convincingly.
- I understand viewer (therefore customer) behaviour online, and have logistics, copyright and  
  legal/music clearance experience.

  Channel 4 News journalist to report and edit a lead story on my own.

  my gap year, and did Swedish and German to A-level standard

## Education

#### Makers Academy (September - December 2019)

- Final project: iPhone native Jack the Ripper game with Swift / Xcode - I had to learn both  
  technologies from scratch. The full-stack project was completed in two weeks, in a group of six, with  
  two-day sprints, daily standups and retros, pair programming and independent research.  I was  
  responsible for a lot of the visual cleanup of the pages, which was great to learn in Xcode. I was  
  scrum master for much of the project, and blogged about my experiences.

## Experience

**Channel 4 News, ITN** (2000-present)    
Current role: News Editor 
- I run the newsdesk, which is the nerve centre of the newsroom. I generate story ideas, spot  
  the best picture of the day, assign reporters and camera crews to cover stories and provide  
  editorial guidance and help with legal compliance. I frequently answer the question  
  "how do we make this into TV?".
- One of my previous roles was Site Editor for Channel 4 News Digital. I managed a team of online  
  journalists in covering the day's stories for our digital platforms. I learned about SEO,  
  thumbnails/story promotion, and to use a CMS and publishing tools.  
- As Producer, my job was to make stories into engaging TV. I became proficient at video editing,  
  learned house style and the differences between the visual style of news in the UK and other  
  countries, especially the US.
- I have trained more than 100 staff across departments on Avid editing software and server tools,  
  including the Washington DC bureau staff.

**CNN International** (1997-2000)   
Satellite Feed Producer
-	Whist studying for my MSc, I worked in the CNN London Master Control Room, booking satellite feeds  
  across the world for CNN's output. We experimented with new tech including TOKO, which allowed CNN  
  to go live to reporters via sat phone video (a big deal at the time!).

**Heart 106.2** (1996-1998)   
Reporter 
- An amazing way to gain experience as a journalist. I got to interview Desmond Tutu and Tony Blair and  
  cover stories from scrabble championships to police raids.

## Hobbies
- I'm in the early stages of writing a book and scrollytelling project from more than 2,000 letters  
  my grandparents sent to each other when my grandfather was fighting in the Finnish Continuation War  
  during WWII.
