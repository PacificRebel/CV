## HELI SIVUNEN

I'm a bilingual developer and multi-skilled TV journalist and newsgathering logistics expert, with years of experience working in national and international TV news at a senior level. Whether in coding or TV production, I love working in small and large groups of talented professionals, and I'm proud to foster a great atmosphere and relationships within my teams. 

I am a graduate of Makers, a 12-week, highly selective coding bootcamp in London. My first programming language is Ruby (including Rails), and I have also worked in Javascript and Swift and experimented with Python. My full-stack work has a strong emphasis on TDD. I spent my three months on the Makers course pair programming, and I've worked in three group projects with Agile practices and a rigorous workflow. I have been selected as scrum master several times because of my leadership and organisational skills.

I care deeply about the environment. I spent several months planning my own business: using ocean plastic to manufacture goods. Last year I mentored a young journalist through the charity The Second Source. I'm a member of ITN's Sustainability Forum which works to reduce the company's carbon footprint, and have recently become vegan to slash my own.

During my career in TV news, I was selected to train Avid video editing to more than a hundred ITN staff, and in that process (someone tried to poach me!) I realised I could make an important contribution towards improving software. I'm now hoping to use my TV production experience to help companies excite their audiences and business clients with elegant but highly practical software.
