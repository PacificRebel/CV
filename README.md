## HELI SIVUNEN

I'm a developer and multi-skilled journalist at Channel 4 News, highly experienced at producing  
visually engaging TV News. I love working in small and large groups of talented professionals,  
and I'm proud to foster a great atmosphere within my team.  

I am a graduate of Makers, a 12-week, selective developer bootcamp in London. The most fun I have when  
I'm coding, is when working in a team or pairs, and tinkering with the visuals of a page.  
I’m currently working on building a portfolio from scratch with React, and I'm taking a top-up React  
course at Makers to improve my front-end skills.  
I’m also learning to make beautiful scrollytelling web pages with HTML and CSS, and a long-term personal  
project is to make a scrollytelling story with WWII letters my grandparents sent to each other.

I've always been known as a tech geek at work, and was selected to train Avid video editing and server  
tools to more than a hundred ITN staff. I realised during that process that I want to write the  
software as well as use it.

I care deeply about the environment. I have experience in corporate carbon footprint reduction as I'm  
a member of ITN's Sustainability Forum, which works to improve the company’s environmental credentials.
