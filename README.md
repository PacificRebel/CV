## HELI SIVUNEN

I'm a multi-skilled, bilingual TV journalist and have loads of experience working in national and international TV news at a senior level. I love working in a large group of talented professionals. I manage two assistants and several camera crews, and I'm proud to foster a really good atmosphere and relationships within my team. I was selected for an Avid 'train the trainer' course to teach video editing to more than a hundred ITN staff, and during that process (someone tried to poach me!) I realised I could make an important contribution towards improving software. I'm now hoping to use my TV production experience to help companies to excite their audiences and business clients with elegant but highly practical software. I care deeply about the environment. I spent several months planning my own business, which would have used ocean plastic to manufacture goods. I abandoned this because I realised the big beasts would catch up soon - I was right! I have volunteered at beach cleans and sit on ITN's Sustainability Forum.
